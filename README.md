Welcome to the DOHN Cleaning Service System — a console-based Java application that allows users to book house cleaning services with flexible options and real-time availability checks.

📌 Features
📅 Check cleaner availability based on day and time

🧼 Choose type of service (set or full)

👥 Select service category (individual, pair, or group)

⏱️ Set service duration (daily, weekly, monthly)

🧾 Auto-generate a receipt and save it to a file (receipt.text)


This is a Java console application that simulates a booking system for a residential cleaning service. Users can:

📅 View cleaner availability based on a weekly schedule

🛠️ Choose service options such as type (set/full), team size (individual/pair/group), and duration (daily/weekly/monthly)

🧍‍♂️ Input personal details like name, phone number, and address

💰 Automatically calculate the total service price based on user selections

🧾 Generate and save a service receipt in a text file (receipt.text)

The project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP), user input validation, 2D array handling, and file I/O operations in Java. It's perfect for beginners learning how to build structured console applications.
